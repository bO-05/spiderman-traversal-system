# Core Principles

The development of the traversal system in Marvel's Spider-Man was guided by a set of core principles that aimed to capture the essence of the superhero's iconic movement while ensuring an enjoyable and accessible gaming experience. These principles served as the foundation for the design and implementation of the swinging mechanics, animation, camera, and overall feel of the game.

The core principles were:

1. [Accessibility](/core-principles/accessibility): Designing a system that is easy to learn but hard to master for a broad audience.
2. [Physics-Based Swinging](/core-principles/physics-based-swinging): Rooting the swinging mechanic in physics for a believable experience.
3. [Attaching to In-World Geometry](/core-principles/attaching-to-geometry): Ensuring swing lines attach to real-world objects for immersion.
4. [Dynamic Camera](/core-principles/dynamic-camera): Using a fluid and cinematic camera to convey speed and motion.

By adhering to these principles, the development team at Insomniac Games was able to create a traversal system that not only felt true to the character of Spider-Man but also provided players with a satisfying and engrossing experience as they swung through the virtual streets of New York City.

The core principles were not only important for the initial design of the traversal system but also served as a guide throughout the iterative development process, ensuring that any changes or improvements aligned with the overall vision for the game.

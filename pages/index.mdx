# Introduction

In this 2019 GDC talk, Doug Sheahan from Insomniac Games takes us on a deep dive into the creation of the traversal system for the critically acclaimed game, Marvel's Spider-Man. The traversal system, which encompasses the iconic web-swinging mechanic and other movement abilities, is a crucial aspect of the game that captures the essence of the beloved superhero.

Throughout the session, Sheahan discusses the core principles, challenges, and iterative process behind developing a fluid and accessible swinging mechanic. The talk covers a wide range of topics, including:

- [Core principles](/core-principles) that guided the development of the traversal system
- The process of [selecting optimal swing points](/swing-point-selection) in the environment
- The [physics and mechanics](/swinging-mechanics) behind the swinging system
- The [iterative process](/iteration-and-refinement) of refining the traversal system based on feedback and testing

Sheahan emphasizes the importance of creating a system that not only feels true to the character but also provides a satisfying and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels. He also highlights the collaborative effort between various disciplines, such as programming, animation, and design, in bringing the traversal system to life.

By the end of the session, attendees will gain valuable insights into the development process of one of the most iconic and well-received traversal systems in recent gaming history. The lessons learned and techniques discussed can be applied to a wide range of projects, making this talk a must-watch for game developers interested in creating engaging and memorable movement mechanics.

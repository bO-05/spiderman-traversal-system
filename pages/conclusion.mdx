# Conclusion

Developing the traversal system for Marvel's Spider-Man was a complex and iterative process that required a deep understanding of game design, physics, animation, and player expectations. Throughout the development journey, several key lessons were learned:

## Keep it Simple

Start with a simple implementation and add complexity only as needed. By keeping the system simple early on, the team was able to avoid going down paths that players wouldn't respond to, saving time and effort. The final system had a wealth of features, many of which were added in response to specific problems uncovered during development.

## Stay Flexible

Be open to adapting mechanics based on feedback and testing. The team initially had design reasons for why certain aspects of the system worked the way they did, but by allowing the game to evolve based on player feedback, they achieved a far superior final product.

## Developers are Not the Best Testers

<Callout type="warning">
Developers know exactly how their systems work and how they are supposed to be used, so when they play the game, it often works exactly as expected. However, different players will approach the game in wildly different ways, revealing problems and edge cases that developers may never encounter.

To uncover these issues, it is essential to:
- Conduct extensive external playtesting
- Challenge the dev team to play the game in different ways
- Continuously gather and act on feedback

## Collaboration is Key

Creating a complex system like the traversal mechanics in Marvel's Spider-Man requires a wide range of skills, including game design, physics programming, animation, and cinematography. Effective collaboration between team members from various disciplines is crucial for success.

## Iterate, Iterate, Iterate

Developing a polished and enjoyable traversal system requires constant iteration and refinement. From [swing point selection](/swing-point-selection) to [swinging mechanics](/swinging-mechanics) and [animation improvements](/iteration-and-refinement/animation-improvements), each aspect of the system underwent numerous iterations based on feedback and testing.

By following these principles and maintaining a focus on player experience, the team at Insomniac Games was able to create a traversal system that captured the essence of Spider-Man's iconic movement, delivering a thrilling and accessible experience for players.

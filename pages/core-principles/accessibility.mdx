# Accessibility

One of the core principles guiding the development of the traversal system in Marvel's Spider-Man was **accessibility**. The goal was to design a system that would be easy for a broad audience to learn and enjoy, while still offering depth and mastery for more experienced players.

## Designing for a Broad Audience

Spider-Man has a massive worldwide following, and the development team wanted to ensure that as many people as possible could play and enjoy the game. However, this presented a unique challenge, as most players don't have any pre-existing muscle memory or experience with swinging mechanics in games.

Unlike more common genres like first-person shooters or third-person action games, players generally don't have a mental model for how swinging should work or feel.

To address this, the team focused on creating controls and mechanics that were intuitive and easy to grasp, even for players who were new to the concept of swinging.

## Easy to Learn, Hard to Master

While accessibility was a key priority, the development team also wanted to ensure that the traversal system offered depth and rewarded skill. The goal was to strike a balance between ease of use and mastery.

<Steps>
### Step 1
Implement simple and intuitive controls that allow players to start swinging and traversing the city with minimal frustration.

### Step 2
Introduce advanced techniques and mechanics that reward players who invest time in mastering the system, such as:
- Chaining together different types of swings
- Timing releases for optimal speed and distance
- Combining swinging with other traversal moves like wall-running and web-zipping
</Steps>

By providing a low barrier to entry while still offering room for growth and mastery, the traversal system aimed to cater to both casual and hardcore players alike.

## Onboarding and Tutorial Design

Another critical aspect of accessibility was the design of the onboarding experience and tutorials. The game throws players right into the action, with Spider-Man leaping out a window and forcing players to start swinging immediately.

To make this initial experience as smooth as possible, the team focused on:
- Providing clear visual and audio cues to guide players through the basic swinging mechanics
- Gradually introducing new traversal moves and techniques over the course of the early game
- Offering optional tutorial messages and challenges to help players practice and refine their skills

By carefully crafting the onboarding experience, the team aimed to minimize frustration and ensure that players of all skill levels could quickly grasp the core mechanics of the traversal system.

## Balancing Accessibility and Depth

Striking the right balance between accessibility and depth was an ongoing challenge throughout the development process. The team constantly iterated on the mechanics, controls, and tutorials based on playtester feedback and usability studies.

Some key lessons learned include:
- Simplifying controls wherever possible to reduce cognitive load and barrier to entry
- Providing assists and automation for complex maneuvers, while still allowing manual control for advanced players
- Clearly communicating the benefits and tradeoffs of different traversal techniques through tutorials and in-game feedback

By continuously refining the traversal system based on player feedback, the team was able to create an experience that was both accessible and satisfying for a wide range of players.

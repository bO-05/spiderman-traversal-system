# Dynamic Camera

One of the core principles behind the traversal system in Marvel's Spider-Man is the use of a dynamic camera to convey a sense of speed, fluidity, and cinematic flair. The camera plays a crucial role in translating the high-flying acrobatics and velocity of Spider-Man's swinging into a visceral experience for the player.

## Goals

The primary goals for the traversal camera were:

1. **Minimize player input**: Reduce the need for players to manually control the camera, allowing them to focus on the traversal mechanics and gameplay.
2. **Accentuate pendulum motion**: Emphasize the pendulum-like motion and forces experienced by Spider-Man while swinging to enhance immersion.
3. **Communicate speed**: Utilize various visual cues to convey a sense of speed and momentum to the player.

## Implementation

<Steps>

### Step 1: Camera Follow Model

The initial approach was based on a follow camera model, where the camera looks in the same direction as Spider-Man's velocity. However, this led to issues with sudden changes in velocity causing large, disorienting view direction changes.

To address this, the camera model was adjusted to have the player "drag" the camera around. This was achieved by:
1. Predicting the player's position based on their current speed
2. Using the predicted position to calculate how it would affect the camera boom and rotation

This approach resulted in a smoother, less noisy camera motion that was more tolerant of velocity changes.

### Step 2: Accentuating Pendulum Motion

To emphasize the pendulum-like motion of swinging, the camera's pitch is manipulated to roughly match the swing arc's pitch. This allows players to feel the motion through the camera.

- On the downswing, the pitch is kept more flattened, allowing players to focus on the horizon and their direction of travel.
- On the upswing, the pitch is exaggerated to communicate the rise more effectively without getting too far into the upswing.

Additionally, the character's position in screen space is moved down and then back up over the course of the swing. This creates a physical tracking response from the player, reinforcing the in-game motion as they look down and up with the character.

### Step 3: Communicating Speed

To convey a sense of speed, multiple visual cues are layered together:

- **Field of View (FOV)**: Adjusting the FOV based on Spider-Man's speed. A wider FOV elongates objects in front of the player and brings more peripheral objects into view, enhancing the perception of speed.
- **Camera Follow Distance**: Rapidly adjusting the camera's follow distance to deal with sudden speed changes, creating a "spring" effect where the camera falls back and then blends closer again.
- **Motion Blur**: Applying motion blur effects to further emphasize the sense of speed and movement.

By combining these techniques, the dynamic camera system in Marvel's Spider-Man successfully immerses players in the traversal experience, making them feel like they are truly swinging through the city as the iconic superhero.

# Usability Testing

Usability testing played a crucial role in shaping the traversal system of Marvel's Spider-Man. By gathering feedback from players and identifying areas for improvement, the development team at Insomniac Games was able to refine the swinging mechanics and create a more enjoyable and accessible experience.

## The Importance of Usability Testing

Developers often become their own worst testers, as they are intimately familiar with the systems they have created. This can lead to a bias towards the intended design, overlooking potential issues that players may encounter. Usability testing helps to bridge this gap by providing valuable insights from a diverse range of players.

## The Testing Process

The usability testing process for Marvel's Spider-Man involved several steps:

<Steps>

### Recruiting a diverse group of players
To ensure a wide range of feedback, the team recruited players with different levels of gaming experience and familiarity with the Spider-Man franchise.

### Observing player interactions
During testing sessions, the development team observed how players interacted with the traversal system, noting any difficulties or frustrations they encountered.

### Gathering feedback
After each session, players were asked to provide feedback on their experience, highlighting both positive aspects and areas that needed improvement.

### Analyzing results
The team analyzed the data gathered from usability testing to identify patterns and prioritize issues to be addressed.

</Steps>

## Key Findings and Improvements

Usability testing revealed several key issues with the initial implementation of the traversal system:

- Players struggled to manage the physics-based swinging, often feeling a lack of control over their movements.
- The mapping of player input to in-game actions was not always intuitive, leading to confusion and frustration.
- Certain moves and mechanics were difficult to execute consistently, hindering the flow of traversal.

Based on these findings, the development team made several improvements to the traversal system:

- Implementing [physics assists](/iteration-and-refinement/physics-assists) to help players manage the swinging mechanics more easily.
- Refining the control scheme to better align with player expectations and provide a more intuitive experience.
- Adjusting the timing and responsiveness of certain moves to make them more accessible and reliable.

## Conclusion

Usability testing is a vital component of game development, particularly when creating complex systems like the traversal mechanics in Marvel's Spider-Man. By actively seeking and incorporating player feedback, developers can refine their designs and deliver a more engaging and accessible experience for their audience.
